#SynthesisAssignment-DuelSys

During the second semester,  I worked on this six-week individual project involved the development of a software solution that allows sport associations to manage their tournaments. The system was designed to support a round-robin tournament system for badminton, and has the potential to support other types of tournament systems and sports in the future.

The project plan, URS, test plan, and test report were all developed to ensure proper project management and quality assurance throughout the development process. A UML class diagram was also created to provide a clear overview of the software solution's structure and functionality while following some of the SOLID principles of software design.

Using C# with Windows Forms and ASP.Net Core Razor Pages, the software solution was implemented with a MySQL database to store and manage the tournament data. The official badminton scoring system was integrated into the software solution to register the results of each game and generate an overview of the games with which players played against each other.

User experience and feedback were given a high priority throughout the development process, with common practices such as hiding sensitive data being followed to ensure user privacy and security. Collaboration with a tutor through mandatory weekly meetings helped guide the development of the project and ensured that the class diagram was implemented with the tutor's approval.

Overall, this project provided a comprehensive software solution for managing tournaments in sports associations, with the potential to be expanded to support additional sports and tournament systems in the future.
